    "### Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive filtering: Enables adaptive filters to adapt to changing conditions by updating parameters based on relevant and recent information while forgetting outdated data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signal processing: Widely used in noise cancellation, echo cancellation, equalization, and channel estimation to accurately estimate and track time-varying parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-stationary environments: Enhances adaptability in scenarios where input signal properties change over time or exhibit non-stationary behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "- System identification: Useful for estimating parameters of unknown systems based on observed input-output data, particularly for tracking time-varying parameters and capturing changes in system dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robustness to outliers: Improves robustness by adaptively adjusting the forgetting factor to assign less weight to outliers, reducing their impact on parameter estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online learning: Suitable for real-time learning scenarios where data arrives sequentially, allowing continuous adaptation and utilization of new information\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource optimization: Optimizes computational resources by allocating effort based on parameter adaptability, leading to improved efficiency in memory usage and computational complexity"
